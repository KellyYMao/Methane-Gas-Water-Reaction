# Data
Data regarding the change in relative temperature and relative humidity for different concentration of gas was obtained and made into a csv file. Methane gas  volume  changed from 0 sccm to  to 0.05 to 0.05 to 0.1 to 0. With the ideal gas assumption, these were determined to be the mole fractions. The average water vapor pressures at each % methane gas was calculated.
