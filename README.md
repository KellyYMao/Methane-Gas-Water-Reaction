# Data
Data regarding the change in relative temperature and relative humidity for different concentration of gas was obtained and made into a csv file. Methane gas  concentration changed from 0% to 0.02% to 0.05% to 0.05% to 0.1% to 0%. The average water vapor pressures at each % methane gas was calculated.
